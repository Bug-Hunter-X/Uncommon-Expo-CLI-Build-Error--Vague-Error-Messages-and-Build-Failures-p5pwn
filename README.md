# Uncommon Expo CLI Build Error

This repository demonstrates an unusual error encountered during the Expo CLI build process. The error lacks specific details, making troubleshooting challenging.  The `expoBug.js` file shows a sample project structure that produces the issue. `expoBugSolution.js` may contain a fix (if found). The main issue is the lack of helpful error messages from Expo CLI during the build process, which hinders debugging.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `expo start`.
3. Attempt to build the app using `expo build:ios` or `expo build:android`. 

## Expected Behavior

A successful build with no errors or warnings.

## Actual Behavior

The build process fails with a vague or unhelpful error message.

## Potential Causes (Speculative)

* Uncommon package configurations
* Interactions with third-party libraries
* Issues with native modules or platform-specific configurations
* Internal Expo CLI bug

## Workaround (if any found)

[Describe any workaround that helps mitigate the issue temporarily.  Provide details and code examples, if applicable. This will be updated after investigation in expoBugSolution.js]
