While using Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual error during the build process. The error message was vague and didn't provide much information about the root cause.  I tried various troubleshooting steps such as cleaning the cache, reinstalling dependencies, and checking for conflicting packages.  However, none of these solved the issue. The build process would consistently fail without providing any specific error codes or details, making it difficult to identify the underlying problem.
