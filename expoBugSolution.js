After extensive investigation, the root cause of the vague Expo CLI build errors was traced back to a conflict between two packages: `react-native-gesture-handler` and `react-native-reanimated`.  The versions were incompatible, leading to silent failures during the build process.  The solution involved carefully reviewing the package versions in `package.json` and ensuring compatibility. The correct versions are now specified in `package.json`. I also added a custom error handler during the build process to catch and report more informative error messages, ensuring that future similar issues are easier to debug.

```javascript
// expoBugSolution.js
// ... (relevant code changes) ...

// Custom error handling
expo.buildAsync().catch(err => {
  console.error("Expo build failed with error:", err);
  // Add more detailed logging or handling as needed
});
```
